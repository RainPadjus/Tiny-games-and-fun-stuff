A collection of old files, games, code snippets.

## First Project: Simple Snake Game
The game is played on a 10x10 grid where the snake moves and grows by eating food. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement and try to avoid hitting the snake's body or going out of bounds.

## Second Project: Sudoku Solver with GUI

This project is a Sudoku solver with a graphical user interface. The solver takes a partially completed Sudoku grid and finds the solution, if possible. The user can interact with the program by clicking on the grid to add or remove numbers and initiate the solving process with a key press.

The code uses a backtracking algorithm to search for the correct solution to the given puzzle. The graphical interface is built using the Pygame library, providing an interactive way for users to input Sudoku puzzles and see the solution unfold on the screen.
